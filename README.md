## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or copy the `InputChip.js` file):**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```


2.  **Install dependencies:**

    If you haven't already, make sure you have `react` and `tailwindcss` installed in your project.

    ```bash
    npm install react tailwindcss
    # or
    yarn add react tailwindcss
    ```

3.  **Configure Tailwind CSS:**

    If you're setting up **Tailwind CSS** for the first time, you'll need to initialize it and include its directives in your main CSS file. Refer to the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for detailed instructions.
